# Prewor Study Guide

## Description

My motivition for starting this project was to provide myself with a means on keeping up with notes for the prework while at the same time utalizing the information from the moduele to familiarize myself with topics which we will continually use throught this program. I was able to familiarize myself with using github to upload changes to my repository, Utalize HTML as a base for text inputs and amplifiying the HTML elemenets through the use of Javascript and CSS.

I solved a multitude of problems throughtout the completion such as learning how to properly impliment HTML text headers, body texts, etc. Create Variables and use if else statements through proper utalization of functions, and working through issues like my repository not being setup as intended and troubleshooting needing to link my generated ssh keys to my git hub account.

## Usage

This file can be used to organize a multitude of notes not just exclusivley for the subjects which I ultimatly decided on. Thanks to the framework provided by the use of HTML, the user can freely manipulate the properties and text of whatever they choose and as such this file can be used as a universal notebook. In addition to this due to the use of Javascript the user can optionally change the output message for the topics covered within the project. This can be done by simply manipulating the array present in the script.js file located in the asset folder. A similar effect can be achieved through the manipulation of the style.css file located in the assets folder, which allows the user to edit the stylization of some of the text even further.
